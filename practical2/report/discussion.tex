As stated in Section~\ref{sec:implementation} our implementation is not
complete due to trouble setting up Sylvan and other technical difficulties.

The technical troubles with Sylvan mostly had to do with the very limited 
documentation on Sylvan and trouble installing Sylvan. The latter is because 
even though Sylvan comes with \textsc{cmake} files and a claim that Sylvan will 
be added to the path, actually running \textsc{cmake} and \texttt{make install}
will not correctly add Sylvan to the path on Mac OSX. Attempting to fix this and
then working around the problem took quite a lot of time. 

Something else which sadly took a lot of time was working with c++. Neither of
us had a lot of experience in this language and familiarizing ourself with the
language and its oddities took quite a lot of time as well, which made 
implementation of our solver considerably slower.
