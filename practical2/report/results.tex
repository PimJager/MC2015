Because the actual implementation is not finished we are sadly unable to
discuss much results. We can not comment on either the capabilities or 
performance of our solver as we can not actually test the solver using any
of the provided example screens.

However we can comment on the features of our implementation if it actually 
completely implemented the formulas and methods mentioned in 
Section~\ref{sec:impl}. If this were the case then our implementation
would be able to read an arbitrary (valid) Sokoban screen and be able to
determine whether or not the screen is solvable.
